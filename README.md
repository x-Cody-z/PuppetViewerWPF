## Download
[v0.1](https://github.com/x-Cody-z/PuppetViewerWPF/releases/download/v0.1/Puppet.Viewer.zip)
## Setup

 - Make sure you have Extended v4 mod for TPDP, this program uses a
   modified dll from it.
 - Copy the dxgi.dll into the game directory, it should overwrite the
   existing one
 - Open Puppet Viewer, click the ? button and open the game .exe

## Instructions

 - The puppet list should fill out automatically when entering battle,
   otherwise hit refresh.
 - P button will switch between parties.
 - Clicking on a puppet in the list will switch from type matchup to
   base stats and abilities.
 - Hovering over an ability will show a description.
 - The Overlay can be toggled with crtl + shift + c, it's kinda buggy so
   give it a few goes if it doesn't show at first.

## Credits
Images, puppet data, original dll and probably some other stuff are either from php42 or ripped from the game with their tools
## To-do

 - Make it look better
 - Fix overlay
 - Stat/ damage calcs
