## Setup
Make sure you have Extended v4 mod for TPDP, this program uses a modified dll from it.
Copy the dxgi.dll into the game directory, it should overwrite the existing one
Open Puppet Viewer, click the ? button and open the game .exe
## Instructions
The puppet list should fill out automatically when entering battle, otherwise hit refresh.
P button will switch between parties.
Clicking on a puppet in the list will switch from type matchup to base stats and abilities.
Hovering over an ability will show a description.
The Overlay can be toggled with crtl + shift + c, it's kinda buggy so give it a few goes if it doesn't show at first.
## Credits
Images, puppet data, original dll and probably some other stuff are either from php42 or ripped from the game with their tools
## To-do
Make it look better
Fix overlay
Stat/ damage calcs
